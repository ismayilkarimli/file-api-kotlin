# Summary

## Usage
I worked over the provided boilerplate, so starting up should follow the same principles.

As for requests, please find them in `resources/http-requests` (some part of this is IntelliJ specific)

## Comments

The acceptance criteria was easy to understand, 
and I had fun while going through the project.

The only "problem" is in assignment.md file, 
"GET file metadata endpoint" appears twice, 
also the file appears to be unstructured around line 68

## Which part of the assignment took the most time and why?

Initial set up took the most time. 
As for the steps, the initial step took most of my time. 
After the initial endpoint, rest of the endpoints was trivial to implement as the main base was already there.

## What You learned

While I was a bit familiar with Kotlin's syntax, 
I learned a lot about it throughout the project such as new keywords and doing things the Kotlin way.

## TODOs

Since, this is a take-home assignment I feel like the scope is sufficient.
However, if I must add some new features:
* File size limit
* File type check
